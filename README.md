Background

As online streaming services become increasingly popular, many movie producers are given an unforeseen platform, outside of the traditional cinemas and theaters, to showcase their productions. As services like Netflix become more and more common, the traditional movie industry becomes progressively competitive for producers that aim to hit the silver screen. 
This project will assist a new online streaming company that is aiming to produce films in-house. The company requires a database that is easy to navigate and is capable of future analytical demands. It hopes through a complete database, it can have a better estimate of the budget to offer to movie producers, as historical data of movie production can provide better visualization of cost production of movies. The team will build a database to better understand the outlook of the movie industry throughout history and the different characteristics of well-received movies in different eras. 

Mission Statement

The purpose of the project is to design and implement a relational database system that organizes and maintains the movie data, allowing the end-users to easily retrieve, insert, delete, and modify the movie information via a graphical user interface, which efficiently coordinates the data analytical needs of the end-users, enabling critics/analysts to conduct data research in an efficient and timely manner. 

Mission Objective

1.	Sort the movie data based on their attributes such as genres, dates, and countries; remove redundant and useless data. 
2.	Establish business rules for inserting, deleting, and modifying data. 
3.	Design a relational E-R diagram to present the data, the data relationships, and the business rules. 
4.	Based on the E-R diagram, implement a relational database to maintain the data. 
5.	Develop a user-friendly Graphical User Interface design, allowing movie information to be retrieved, added, deleted, and modified via forms. 
6.	Provide data visualizations to help data analysts better understand the data.

Scope
The database will be built upon a 6000 unit plus dataset that was collected by imdb.com. The dataset ranges from 1986-2016 with 6820 movies included. The majority of movies in the dataset originates from the USA, with Comedy and Drama being the two most common genres in the dataset.
